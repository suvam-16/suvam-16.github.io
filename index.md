# üßë‚Äçüíª Professional Self Assesment:

## Showcasing strength and Professional Growth
Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have grown both technically and professionally. Developing the Event Tracking App and refining it across multiple milestones for my capstone project allowed me to synthesize everything I‚Äôve learned from front-end design to back-end architecture. My ePortfolio reflects this growth and showcases not just the technical artifacts I‚Äôve built, but also my ability to approach real-world challenges.

Building and enhancing my ePortfolio has helped me identify my strengths in full-stack development, user-centered design, and problem-solving. My capstone project in particular demonstrates my capability to modernize legacy systems, refactor application architecture, and ensure scalable and secure communication between a mobile client and a backend server. These experiences reinforced my professional goal to work as a systems engineer in the aerospace and defense industry; a field that demands robust system integration, meticulous testing, and secure design, all of which align with the skills I‚Äôve gained.

Outside the capstone, my coursework helped me grow in areas such as agile development, and working with modern frameworks like Flask, Android SDK, and MySQL. I‚Äôve also had the opportunity to practice technical documentation, debugging strategies, and UI/UX principles‚Äîexperiences that have strengthened my values of precision, usability, and maintainability in software engineering.

One of the most valuable aspects of the program was collaborating in a team environment, especially through informal yet highly effective peer interactions on platforms like Discord. During several courses, including the capstone, I worked closely with classmates who were incredibly supportive and knowledgeable. We shared feedback, discussed coding challenges, and helped troubleshoot each other‚Äôs issues from Android Studio errors to backend connectivity problems. These peer-to-peer collaborations mirrored real-world software development teamwork, where communication and shared problem solving are essential to project success. Through these experiences, I developed strong collaboration skills and learned the importance of leveraging a community to grow both technically and professionally.

Equally important was communicating with stakeholders, a skill I developed through written reports, presentations, and technical explanations while getting constant feedback from my peers or instructor. I learned how to translate technical details into language that‚Äôs understandable to non-technical audiences, whether outlining a design decision, documenting API functionality, or discussing project progress.

In terms of software engineering and databases, I enhanced the app‚Äôs architecture by transitioning from a local SQLite database to a scalable Flask API with a MySQL backend. This full-stack approach gave me hands-on experience with database schema design, HTTP endpoint creation, and client-server communication using Volley which are skills directly applicable in modern software development. The project also allowed me to apply my knowledge of data structures and algorithms in practical ways. I implemented sorting and search features using custom logic that prioritized real-time responsiveness and user experience. Though binary search was initially considered, I opted for linear search to support partial matches; demonstrating thoughtful algorithm selection based on the user and platform context. I also developed a secure login and registration system through the API, emphasizing data integrity and authentication.

## Atrifacts Summary
My ePortfolio includes artifacts that represent the breadth and depth of my skills. The Event Tracking App is the centerpiece, showcasing UI/UX improvements, event sorting and search algorithms, and full-stack integration with a Flask/MySQL backend. Each milestone builds upon the previous, moving from visual enhancements to algorithmic functionality and ultimately backend replacement with scalable infrastructure.

Together, these artifacts provide a clear, cohesive picture of my computer science abilities, demonstrating not only how I‚Äôve learned to build software, but how I‚Äôve learned to think like an engineer. My portfolio tells the story of my progression from a student learning syntax and structure to a developer capable of designing, implementing, and refining real-world systems.

As I prepare to take the next step in my career, this professional self-assessment serves as a testament to the knowledge, skills, and values I bring to the field. I look forward to contributing to innovative and meaningful projects that solve complex problems and serve critical missions.
